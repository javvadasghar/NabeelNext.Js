          We (I Want It, LLC) hope you find our site useful. By accessing or
          otherwise interacting with our servers, services, websites, mobile app
          ("App"), or any associated content/postings (together, "IWI"), you
          agree to these Terms of Use ("TOU") (last updated November 1, 2023).
          You acknowledge and agree IWI is a private site owned and operated by
          I Want It, LLC. If you are accessing or using IWI on behalf of a
          business, you represent and warrant to IWI that you have authority to
          accept the TOU on behalf of that business and that that business
          agrees to the TOU. If you do not agree to the TOU, you are not
          authorized to use IWI or download the App. We may modify the TOU at
          any time at our sole discretion. You are responsible for periodically
          checking for changes and are bound by them if you continue to use IWI.
          Our privacy policy, prohibited list, and all other policies, site
          rules, and agreements referenced below or on IWI, are fully
          incorporated into this TOU, and you agree to them as well.

          LICENSE
        </div>
        If you agree to the TOU and (1) are of sufficient age and capacity to
        use IWI and be bound by the TOU, or (2) use IWI on behalf of a business,
        thereby binding that business to the TOU, we grant you a limited,
        revocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to use IWI in
        compliance with the TOU; unlicensed use is unauthorized. You agree not
        to display, "frame," make derivative works, distribute, license, or
        sell, content from IWI, excluding postings you create. You grant us a
        perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable
        license to use, copy, display, distribute, and make derivative works
        from content you post.
        <div className="bg-dark-green text-black font-bold w-fit my-2">USE</div>
        Unless licensed by us in a separate written or electronic agreement, you
        agree not to use or provide software (except our App and general purpose
        web browsers and email clients) or services that interact or
        interoperate with IWI, e.g. for downloading, uploading,
        creating/accessing/using an account, posting, flagging, emailing,
        searching, or mobile use. You agree not to copy/collect IWI content via
        robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, or any automated or manual
        equivalent (e.g., by hand). Misleading, unsolicited, and/or unlawful
        postings/communications/accounts are prohibited, as is buying or selling
        accounts. You agree not to post content that is prohibited by any of
        IWI's policies or rules referenced above ("Prohibited Content"). You
        agree not to abuse IWI's flagging or reporting processes. You agree not
        to collect IWI user information or interfere with IWI. You agree we may
        moderate IWI access/use at our sole discretion, e.g., by blocking,
        filtering, re-categorizing, re-ranking, deleting, delaying, holding,
        omitting, verifying, or terminating your
        access/license/listings/account. You agree (1) not to bypass said
        moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating or not moderating, and
        (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not. Unless
        licensed by us in a separate written or electronic agreement, you agree
        not to (i) rent, lease, sell, publish, distribute, license, sublicense,
        assign, transfer, or otherwise make available IWI or our application
        programming interface ("API"), (ii) copy, adapt, create derivative works
        of, decompile, reverse engineer, translate, localize, port or modify the
        App, the API, any website code, or any software used to provide IWI,
        (iii) combine or integrate IWI or the API with any software, technology,
        services, or materials not authorized by us, (iv) circumvent any
        functionality that controls access to or otherwise protects IWI or the
        API, or (v) remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other
        proprietary rights notices. You agree not to use IWI or the API in any
        manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise
        violates any intellectual property right or other right of any person,
        or that violates any applicable law.

        unlawful IWI account or buying/selling a IWI account - $4 per violation;

        violations of the USE Section - $1,000 per violation; (K) aggregating,

        page during the 24 hour period after the first 1,000 pages; (M)
        bypassing or attempting to bypass our moderation efforts - $4 per
        violation. You agree that these amounts are (1) a reasonable estimate of
        our damages (as actual damages are often difficult to calculate), (2)
        not a penalty, and (3) not otherwise limiting on our ability to recover
        under any legal theory or claim, including statutory damages and other
        equitable relief (e.g., for spam, we can elect between the above
        liquidated damages or statutory damages under the anti-spam statute).
        You further agree that repeated violations of the USE section will
        irreparably harm and entitle us to injunctive or equitable relief, in
        addition to monetary damages.
